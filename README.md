# 2024_08_27_BooleanUnityEventBox
Box of Boolean Unity Event of range of type.


Some time I need a simple UnityEvent<bool>
but sometime I need only when it is true or false.
Some time all three kinds.

This toolbox is that. Just management of Unity Event with boolean to put in your code that should not move with time.
